# Jose Aranda Data Analyst Portfolio (work in progress)
## Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! 
This repository is meant to contain examples of analysis I've done while working with MySQL and Tableau. This repository is filled with a variety of projects ranging from solo projects, projects from data analytics certificate courses, and projects inspired by 
YouTube videos. Ultimately, this is meant to showcase my skills and expertise in data analysis and data manipulation using SQL, while highlighting my experience with visualizing data through Tableau.

## 1. World Layoff
- **Data:** [Layoffs dataset (CSV)](https://github.com/jaranda915/Case_studies/blob/main/layoffs.csv)
- **Code:** MySQL_clean or MySQL_analyze

In this project I used a dataset found within a github repository that was filled with different companies and industries from different parts of the world showcasing their employee layoffs for the years 2020-2023. This project was my first attempt to analyze a dataset. 
Therefore, the main focus of this project was to find out as much as possible from this data. The three main analysis from this project was analyzing the progression of layoffs, analyzing the top 5 companies that laid off the most employees per year, and analyzing what 
business type got affected the most by these layoffs.
